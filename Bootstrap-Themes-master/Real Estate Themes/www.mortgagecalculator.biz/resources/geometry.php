<p>From architecture and art, to  sports and cars, and even nature, geometry shapes the world around us.  Used to understand objects in terms of their  size, shape, and position, geometry focuses on two-dimensional and  three-dimensional shapes and figures.   Educators in the early grades face the task of helping students to  study, explore, and understand the properties and relationships of those shapes  and figures, while high school geometry teachers help students develop their  spatial reasoning and problem-solving skills through investigating and proving geometric  theorems and properties. </p>

</ul>
<h2>Grades Pre-K – 4</h2>
<p>In the early years of geometry  instruction, students study shapes and solids.   They develop problem-solving skills, deductive reasoning skills, and the  ability to understand transformations, symmetry, and spatial reasoning.  With the development of the <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/G/">Common Core State Standards</a>, these young students are expected to be able to identify and  describe shapes; analyze, compare, create, and compose shapes; reason with  shapes and their attributes; draw and identify lines and angles; and classify  shapes by the properties of their lines and angles.</p>

<p><a href="file:///C:\Users\Russell\Downloads\luminations.nctm.org\Lesson.aspx%3fid=456">Three Sides</a></p>
<p>In this Pre-K – 2 lesson, students  compare shapes, including various types of triangles, to determine the properties  of triangles.  Simple materials like  attribute blocks allow students to use both the visual images and concrete  shapes to help them describe the shapes and explain their reasoning for  determining which shapes are, indeed, triangles.  <em>Source: </em><a href="http://illuminations.nctm.org"><em>Illuminations - NCTM</em></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/geometryplayground/Activities/GP_Activities_K-2/StringShapes_K-2_v4.pdf">String Shapes</a></p>
<p>This group activity involving  common classroom materials such as string and masking tape, allows K – 2  students to explore shapes and experiment with making new shapes.  Beginning with three students holding onto  the string, teachers reinforce properties of shapes by instructing students to  determine which shapes they can make with various numbers of people in their  group.  Working through numbers 3 – 8,  students learn they are able to make a variety of shapes with varying length,  types of angles, and numbers of sides. <em>Source: </em><a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/geometryplayground/Activities/GP_Activities_K-2/StringShapes_K-2_v4.pdf"><em>Geometry  Playground - Exploratorium</em></a></p>

<p>Pre-K – 2 students will create  paths for one another from one location to another using navigation words involving  spatial relations and measurement.  Once  students are comfortable with navigation, they will solve the problem of  getting a ladybug to her leaf.  The  lesson incorporates kinesthetic and visual elements as well as hands-on  activities and technology.  <em>Source: </em><a href="http://illuminations.nctm.org"><em>Illuminations - NCTM</em></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.proteacher.org/a/57320_geometry_walk.html">Geometry Walk</a></p>
<p>One way to get elementary school  students interested in geometry is to help them recognize shapes in their  environment: a Geometry Walk around the school is a perfect solution.  This lesson offers suggestions for  differentiating the lesson based on students&rsquo; age, as younger students may  label shapes with Post-It notes while older students may capture shapes using  digital photography.  Graphing the results  as an extension activity to other areas of mathematics is another way to  differentiate the lesson.  <em>Source: </em><a href="http://www.proteacher.org"><em>The Proteacher Collection</em></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www-tc.pbs.org/teachers/mathline/lessonplans/pdf/esmp/strutsnstuff.pdf">Struts &lsquo;N Stuff</a></p>
<p>This lesson could be used as a  culminating activity for a 3rd/4th grade geometry unit,  because students construct polygons to determine which are rigid and how many  struts would be needed to make different polygons rigid.  Exploration and experimentation occur in  small-group settings, with students sharing and graphing their findings to aid  them in making predictions about other polygons.  <em>Source: </em><a href="http://www.pbslearningmedia.org"><em>PBS Learning Media - Mathline</em></a></p>
<h2>Grades 5 – 8</h2>
<p>The middle years of geometry  instruction call for students to study the properties and relationships of shapes  and solids.  They develop more abstract thinking  capabilities that lead to analysis and reasoning skills.  With the development of the <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/G/">Common Core State Standards</a>, these adolescent students are expected to be able to graph  points on the coordinate plane to solve real-world and mathematical problems;  classify two-dimensional figures into categories based on their properties;  solve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, surface area,  volume, angle measure, and the volume of cylinders, cones, and spheres; draw,  construct, and describe geometric figures and describe the relationships  between them; understand congruence and similarity using physical models,  transparencies, or geometric software; and understand and apply the Pythagorean  Theorem.</p>

<h2>Grades 9 – 12</h2>
<p>High school geometry instruction requires  more analysis, deductive and analytic reasoning, and problem solving than the  previous years of instruction.  The <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/G/">Common Core State Standards</a> become even more rigorous at this level, as students analyze the  properties of two- and three-dimensional shapes, reason about geometric  relationships, and use the coordinate system.   Specifically, these young adults are expected to focus on six areas of  geometry: congruence; similarity, right triangles, and trigonometry; circles;  expressing geometric properties with equations; geometric measurement and  dimension; and modeling with geometry.  These  six areas of the CCSS align with the NCTM&rsquo;s four geometry subcategories.</p>

<p>The CCSS also outline eight <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSG/introduction/">mathematical practices</a> for high school students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sense  of problems and persevere in solving them.</li>
  <li>Reason  abstractly and quantitatively.</li>
  <li>Construct  viable arguments and critique reasons of others.</li>
  <li>Model with  mathematics.</li>
  <li>Use  appropriate tools strategically.</li>
  <li>Attend to  precision.</li>
  <li>Look for and  make use of structure.</li>
  <li>Look for and  express regularity in repeated reasoning.</li>
</ul>
