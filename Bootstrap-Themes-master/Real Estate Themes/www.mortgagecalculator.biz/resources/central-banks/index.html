  The Central Bank represents the intersection between the  Government and the financial currency of the United States. Because the Central  Bank is a multi-disciplinary entity in the real world, teaching students about  the Central Bank is influenced by several sets of Standards: </p>
<ul class="arrow">
  <li><a href="http://www.socialstudies.org/standards">The  National Curriculum Standards for Social Studies</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://new.civiced.org/standards?page=k4toc">National Standards for  Civics and Government</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://jumpstart.org/assets/files/standard_book-ALL.pdf">National  Standards in K-12 Personal Finance Education</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.councilforeconed.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/voluntary-national-content-standards-2010.pdf">Voluntary  National Content Standards in Economics</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While these standards serve as an overall guide to teaching  topics relevant to the Central Bank which coordinate with accepted standards  across various disciplines, teachers should evaluate state standards to ensure  compliance with accepted curriculum protocols. Teaching about the Central Bank  encompasses multiple disciplines, including social studies, economics,  financial literacy, mathematics, and even geography. </p>
<p><br>

<p><br>
  Because of the multiple disciplinary influences, studying  the Central Bank is a valuable educational path for students at all grade  levels, building on foundational knowledge such as currency, supply and demand,  banking, interest rates, and other concepts to develop a deep understanding of  the role of central banking in societies and the impacts of a central banking  system on both national and global economies. </p>
<h2>Grades K-4</h2>
<p>In grades K through 4, students begin to develop an  understanding that money exists in a finite amount, eventually working in the  concepts of debt and loans. At the later stages, interest rates may be  investigated at an introductory level. </p>
<h3>Supply and Demand </h3>

  <li><a href="http://www.proteacher.org/c/206_Classroom_Money_System.html">Classroom  Money System</a> <br>
  This lesson describes setting up a classroom economy using a  simple monetary system. The creator uses the system for a fifth grade class.  That said, it's an excellent activity to use with K through 4th  graders to foster an understanding of the basics of an economic structure with  real-world applicability with little to no modification. <em>Source: </em><a href="http://www.proteacher.org/"><em>ProTeacher Collection</em></a> </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/education/its_all_about_your_money.pdf">It's  All About Your $</a><br>
  &ldquo;It's All About Your $&rdquo; is a set of classroom activities  developed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to help teachers foster an  understanding of essential economic and financial principles in young learners.  A series of handouts and guided activities will engage students in learning  about currency throughout history, counterfeiting, and basic budgeting. <em>Source: </em><a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/"><em>Federal  Reserve Bank of New York</em></a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.proteacher.com/redirect.php?goto=452">Penny  Saved</a><br>
    This lesson plan includes a reading of <u>Alexander, Who  Used to be Rich Last Sunday</u>, and then participate in an activity in which  they decide whether to spend or save money, go through the process of making  mock deposits and keeping a deposit record in a mock savings account. This is a  valuable foundational lesson in spending and saving, on which students will  later build upon with knowledge of accumulating interest and compounding  interest rates, as well as concepts such as opportunity cost. <em>Source: </em><a href="http://www.successlink.org/"><em>SuccessLink</em></a></li>

<h3>The Government's Role  in Money </h3>
<ul class="arrow">
  <li><a href="http://kids.usa.gov/grown-ups/lesson-plans/money/explaining-taxes-to-kids/index.shtml">Explaining  Taxes to Students Lesson Plan (Grades 3 - 5)</a><br>
  Understanding the concepts behind paying taxes helps foster  an understanding of the importance of money, revenues, and currency to the  functioning of the economy. This lesson for elementary students introduces  students to income tax, sales tax, property tax, and how these different taxes  impact the actual cost of goods and services. <em>Source: </em><a href="http://kids.usa.gov/index.shtml"><em>Kids.gov</em></a> </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.econedlink.org/lessons/index.php?lid=978&type=educator">Goods  and Services: Some are Private, Some are Not</a><br>
  Why do we have to pay for some things, but not others?  Students will learn the difference between public and private goods and  services and examine the increasing role of Government in economic life in the  20th and 21st Centuries. By creating a community map  bulletin board, students will look at the goods and services available in their  own community and gain an understanding of why the Government provides certain  things for its citizens. Additionally, students will learn about programs to  provide safety for low-income families and senior citizens. <em>Source: </em><a href="http://www.econedlink.org/"><em>EconEdLink</em></a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.econedlink.org/lessons/index.php?lid=460&type=educator">No  Funny Money, Honey…I Want the Real Thing!</a><br>
    Most children usually believe that money can simply be  printed if it runs out. This lesson addresses that misconception with a review  of the Government's security protocols that deter counterfeiting and enable law  enforcement to track down counterfeiters. As a supplement, students in upper  grade levels may evaluate potential ramifications of easily copied money. <em>Source: </em><a href="http://www.econedlink.org/"><em>EconEdLink</em></a></li>

<ul class="arrow">
  <li><a href="http://www.econedlink.org/lessons/index.php?lid=57&type=student">Frontier  Specialists</a> <br>
  This lesson examines the Seattle protest and the impacts on  world trade. Students envision themselves in the role of a family in the year  1840. They realize that the local families each have different specialized  production skills, and evaluate the potential benefits and consequences of each  family focusing on producing only that which it does best, while trading the  remainder of their needed goods and services with others locally. This is an  excellent introduction to the concept of free trade and global trade, absolute  and competitive advantage, and the economic impacts of shifts in the existing  structure. <em>Source: </em><a href="http://www.econedlink.org/"><em>EconEdLink</em></a> </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.discoveryeducation.com/teachers/free-lesson-plans/money-kids-and-cash.cfm">Money:  Kids and Cash</a><br>
  In this basic lesson for elementary education, students will  learn the concept of banking and earning interest. Students will compare banks  and determine which institution offers the best savings plans. Additionally,  students will gain an understanding of interest as a percentage, as well as the  basic functions of a bank in terms of borrowing and lending. <em>Source: </em><a href="http://www.discoveryeducation.com/"><em>Discovery  Education</em></a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.totally3rdgrade.com/lesson_plan_supply_demand.html">&ldquo;Supply  and Demand&rdquo;</a> <br>
    Understanding supply and demand is an essential building  block for later learning about the supply and demand of money in the economy  and how adjusting interest rates will influence the supply of money readily  available by consumers. This lesson involves an auction-like activity, which  clearly illustrates the power of supply and demand in altering the cost of  goods. The lesson culminates with students setting up random objects and  playing the role of merchants. <em>Source: </em><a href="http://www.totally3rdgrade.com/"><em>Totally3rdGrade.com</em></a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Grades 5-8</h2>
<p>Students in grades 5 through 8 have a better grasp of the  concept of earning wages to pay for food, shelter, clothing, other necessities,  and luxuries. Students gain a firmer understanding of financial responsibility,  so investigations into ways different financial decisions can impact other  areas of life are common activities at this stage. </p>

  A similar lesson to the lesson included for K through 4th  graders above, this activity involves setting up a classroom economy. This  particular lesson plan, however, takes the system a step further with a weekly  discussion of salaries, in which students evaluate different classroom jobs and  determine a fair salary for the &ldquo;employee.&rdquo; This ongoing activity provides an  ideal framework for incorporating math, addition, subtraction, making change,  and other essential mathematics skills. <em>Source: </em><a href="http://www.proteacher.org/"><em>ProTeacher  Collection</em></a> </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.moneyinstructor.com/wsp/wsp0060.asp">Time  Value of Money</a> <br>
  Students learn about the time value of money through a  series of worksheet calculations which illustrate how the same amount of money  will be worth less or more in one year, depending on whether the student  chooses to spend or save it. Students gain an understanding of concepts such as  Present Value and Future Value, as well as how to calculate Future Value with  interest. <em>Source: </em><a href="http://www.moneyinstructor.com/"><em>MoneyInstructor.com</em></a></li>

  In this lesson from the United States Mint, students will  review the history of currency and how it relates to the establishment of  banking systems and the continuation of credit. Core concepts include wealth  and power, credit, and other related terms. Students will define money and  consider how the U.S. currency system would differ if it consisted only of  quarters. Further analysis asks students to weigh the consequences of physical  currency as the only means of trade and the value of credit in the establishment  of international exchange. <em>Source: </em><a href="http://www.usmint.gov/"><em>United  States Mint</em></a></li>

  Students examine the birth of paper money as a consistent,  convenient currency for trade and observe the effects of too little money on a  colonial economy. By reading &ldquo;Benjamin Franklin and the Birth of a Paper Money  Economy,&rdquo; students will learn about Benjamin Franklin's critical role in  developing our understanding of money's impacts on the economy. This lesson  addresses relevant standards for both grades 4 and 8. <em>Source: </em><a href="http://www.philadelphiafed.org/"><em>Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia</em></a> </li>

    Designed for 7th and 8th graders, this  lesson illustrates the functions of the Federal Reserve System, making use of a  video available free of charge from the Federal Reserve. Students are then  divided into groups: cash, credit, loan, or producer, and participate in an  activity that demonstrates the various roles that exist to keep the economy in  balance. With role-playing activities that delve into these concepts in detail,  this lesson may be planned to take place over several class periods. <em>Source: </em><a href="http://www.vamentoring.org/"><em>Virginia  Mentoring Partnership</em></a></li>

  This lesson is actually intended as a preparatory activity  for students who will go on a tour of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, but  it's suitable as a stand-alone activity as well. Students will learn how the  Federal Reserve Bank controls the money supply in the United States, about M1  and M2 and maintaining the balance between the two to facilitate economic  growth. Through a series of hypothetical scenarios and problems, students will  learn how to calculate potential money creation from a starting deposit, define  the three key functions of the Federal Reserve Bank, and how the money supply  is impacted by bank loans, payoffs, savings, and other financial activities. <em>Source: </em><a href="http://www.frbatlanta.org/"><em>Federal  Reserve Bank of Atlanta</em></a></li>

    This fun activity designed for students in grades 9 through  12 requires students to think critically about budgeting, expenses, supply, and  converting costs into daily rates to plan a road trip. Students are required to  construct a budget, calculating the funds required for gas, hotels, food,  entertainment costs, and more. As a supplement, students may participate in a  group discussion about economic factors and the impact on commodity prices,  such as fuel, and how economic conditions influence family decision-making in  terms of travel and vacationing. During periods of economic recession,  consumers cut back on these expenses – discuss how the Fed adjusts interest rates  in order to encourage consumer spending to drive economic growth. <em>Source: </em><a href="http://www.sharemylesson.com/"><em>Share  My Lesson</em></a> </li>
